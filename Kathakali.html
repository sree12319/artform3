      <div class="text-bg-info p-3">Famous around the world, Kathakali's magnificence has won great admiration for the state of Kerala.
         Proud that this renowned artfrom originated, was originated from Kerala’s shores over 300 years ago. 
         It combines devotion, drama, dance, music, costumes and make up into a divine experience for all who get to view it. It retells the great stories of the past, mostly from Indian epics, and leaves one spellbound at the various intricacies involved in the performance.
          Every single quiver of the lips, flicker of the eyes or a movement involving the fingers twirling, has great significance.
           The entire performance sees the audience unable to take their eyes away from the spectacle taking place on stage.
           The themes of the Kathakali are religious in nature.  They typically deal with the Mahabarat, the Ramayana and the ancient scriptures known as the Puranas.  This is performed in a text which is generally Sanskritised Malayalam.

             A Kathakali performance is a major social event.  They generally start at dusk and go through out the night.  Kathakali is usually performed only by men.  Female cha­rac­ters are portrayed by men dressed in women's costume. 
              However, in recent years, women have started to become Kathakali dan­cers.

             Kathakali has a long tradition.  It dates back to the 17th century.  It was given its pres­ent form by Mahakavi Vallathol Narayan Menon, who was the founder of the Kerala Kala Mandalam.

               The actors rely very heavily on hand gesture to convey the story.  These hand gestures, known as mudra, are com­mon through out much of classical In­dian dance.
